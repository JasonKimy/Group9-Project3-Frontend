Project Proposal – Wander
Wander is a gamified mobile app that motivates users to explore their city through weekly
themed challenges. Each week, users receive several challenge “decks” such as Coffee Shops,
Hiking Trails, Restaurants, or Gyms. Each deck lists real nearby places chosen using location
and weather data. When users visit a place, they check in (GPS-verified) and may take a
photo to earn a collectible Place Card. Cards can level up through repeat visits. Completing
all places in a deck rewards points and adds that deck to the user’s collection; points can
unlock additional weekly challenges.
Key Features
● Login / Authentication: Google OAuth 2.0 sign-in.
● Weekly Challenges: 2–5 themed decks generated from weather + location data.
● Check-Ins: Verified by GPS with optional photo upload.
● Card Collection: Collect and level cards for visited places.
● Points & Rewards: Earn points for completing decks and unlock more challenges.
Technology Stack
Frontend – React Native (Expo) Backend – Spring Boot (API with ≥ 8 endpoints)
Database – Supabase PostgreSQL
Auth – Google OAuth 2 (Spring Security) APIs – Google Places & OpenWeather Hosting –
Heroku / Render
Developer Roles
● Backend Developer 1 – User & Auth: Implement Google OAuth 2 login, manage user

animations, rewards, and leaderboard display.
Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
